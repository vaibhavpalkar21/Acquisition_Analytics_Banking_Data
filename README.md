Predict the probability of response of each prospect and target the ones most likely to respond to the next telemarketing campaign. 

1. Identify the relevant predictor variables for response using EDA
2. Build predictive models and choose the best one
3. Sort the prospects in decreasing probability of response (predicted by the best model) and target the top X% (or top Y deciles), where X would be determined by your business objective (e.g. maximising the overall response rate/the number of responders at a fixed marketing cost)
